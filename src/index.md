Hey, I'm ReduxFlakes and this is my cozy little corner of the internet. I'm a 16-year-old computer science student from Portugal, and I'm really into all things web, Android, and Python development. In my spare time, I like to contribute to the open source community and I'm a FOSS as well as privacy advocate, so fair warning, you might see me get a little fired up when it comes to proprietary software and privacy issues. Btw I **LOVE** music!
