A welcome post because any blog needs one of those ðŸ˜œ

</article>

        <p>Hey, welcome to my blog! This is an introduction post to talk about me and my website.</p>
<p>I always tried making a blog but for some reason I simply couldn't, I mean I tried 10 times probably because I procrastinate a lot as all the developers out there do, am I right? ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Anyway, this is my last attempt at making a blog and a website as a whole. I'm a person that gets tired easily, which results in making things from scratch, sometimes from the ground up, resulting in a nice but empty website because of a lack of content.</p>
<p>With the new year I decided to change myself...by procrastinate less, smart right? So I decided to focuse more on content then design, you can actually notice it, the website is pretty basic but that's the point. Most of my inspiration came from the post <a href="https://kevq.uk/a-brutally-simple-site/">A Brutally Simple Site</a> from Kev Quirk where he talks about <a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">Brutalist Web Design</a> which sums up everything that I said, raw content instead of complex designs.</p>
